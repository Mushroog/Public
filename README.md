1) CustomControls project.

A predictive textbox for .NET, extending RichTextBox.

The textbox can be 'fed' with chunks of text, and builds a dictionary of the words in the text. When input matches the
first letters of a known (dictionary) word, the remaining letters of the word are added as selected text. If there are 
multiple matches, the up/down arrow keys navigate the list.

A dialog box for editing the dictionary is provided.
